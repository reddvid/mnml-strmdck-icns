# mnml icns for elgt strmdck

---

\*\*Ok, these icons aren't minimal after all - especially icons for apps - they're just HD compared to the ones fetched from the app.

I recently bought an Elgato Stream Deck MK.2 which I should've made long ago.

I actually never thought that the deck can be used without the "unchangeable" height stand. So far putting it on the table works just fine.

Setting the device is easier but I felt like some icon designs (the ones I needed) are very basic and were not standard.

So I try to make my own minimal but on-context (for me) icons.
